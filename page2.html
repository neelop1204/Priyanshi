            <p>Recently, I've noticed our communication has decreased, and I've found myself overthinking a lot. It's led me to realize something important:</p>

                I have developed feelings for you, Priyanshi.

            <h2>Reasons Behind My Feelings</h2>

            <p>I've always valued our friendship and the moments we've shared. You've been there with me through all the significant milestones in my life, and I truly believe you've been a lucky charm for me.</p>

            <p>The main reason I wanted to share all of this with you is to let you know my true feelings. I like you, and I love you. I lacked the confidence to say it directly, so I chose this way to express my feelings. Just click on the next for the last page.</p>
