    <h1>Hi Priyanshi,</h1>
    <p>
        I hope you're doing well. I want to apologize for my behavior during our last call; I know it was rude, and I'm sorry for ending it abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you remember the first time we met after finishing 10th grade? It was during an IELTS class back in May 2022. I was shy, and I never imagined we would become such good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those three months were incredible. From attending classes together to the day of the exam on August 6th, our time together was filled with laughter and support. You believed in me when I doubted myself, especially when I received my exam results and applied for admission abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
        We started our journey to Canada together, and those days were unforgettable. Your support has been a constant source of strength for me, from academic achievements to landing a job at Domino's.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been wanting to share something special with you for a while now, and I thought this would be the best way to express a message. So, let's continue to the next page.
